=head1 CAVEATS

Not all of the programs of the original separate perl packages have
been converted successfully to C<C>.

=head1 HISTORY

Many of the tools in the B<xde-applets> package were originally written
as perl programs in separate packages.  One of the problems with
using perl for various things X is that perl has no support for various
libraries such as ICE, X11 session management and startup notification.
These libraries are useful things for a desktop environment.  Therefore,
each of the applets in the separate packages were converted from
perl programs to C<C> language programs.
