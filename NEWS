Release xde-applets-0.10 released 2020-08-15
--------------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 0.10

0.10            Preliminary Release 0.10

    This is the tenth release of the xde-applets package. This package
    provides a number of "C"-language applets for the system tray that
    provide various functions from package management to wireless
    connections. Some of these applets were originally written in perl(1)
    as separate applications. They have now been converted to "C" for speed
    and to provide access to libraries not available from perl(1).

    This release is a preliminary release that provides fixes for battery
    level sound support.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.
