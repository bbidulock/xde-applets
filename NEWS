xde-applets -- history of user-visible changes.  2019-09-03

Release xde-applets-0.6 released 2019-09-03
-------------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 0.6

0.6             Preliminary Release 0.6

    This is the fifth release of the xde-applets package. This package
    provides a number of "C"-language applets for the system tray that
    provide various functions from package management to wireless
    connections. Some of these applets were originally written in perl(1)
    as separate applications. They have now been converted to "C" for speed
    and to provide access to libraries not available from perl(1).

    This release is a preliminary release that simply sets autoconf
    directory defaults better and improves the build system more.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.

Release xde-applets-0.5 released 2019-08-31
-------------------------------------------

git tag -n100 -l 0.5

0.5             Preliminary Release 0.5

    This is the fifth release of the xde-applets package. This package
    provides a number of "C"-language applets for the system tray that
    provide various functions from package management to wireless
    connections. Some of these applets were originally written in perl(1)
    as separate applications. They have now been converted to "C" for speed
    and to provide access to libraries not available from perl(1).

    This release is a preliminary release that updates the build system,
    generates better NEWS files, handles annotated tags better, and
    converts the release archives to lzip compression. A number of the
    applets are still incomplete; however, some are almost complete, such
    as the battery and sensors applets.

    Included in the release is an autoconf tarball for building the package
    from source. See the NEWS and TODO file in the release for more
    information. Please report problems to the issues list on GitHub.
